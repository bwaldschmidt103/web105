            <p>
                <br>My family is my life. Everything that I do is meant to enhance the quality of life for them. During family time, my wife and I enjoy taking the kids to the park, being outdoors, and getting fresh air. We love reading books to the kids and getting them involved with toys that inspire building, molding, and creativity.
