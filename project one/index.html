        <p>My name is Brian Waldschmidt. I turned 45 this year. I'm an INFJ empath and I love the outdoors. I spend my weekends with the kids staying young and burning off calories. I'm seen with my wife Sara at the Lincolnpark zoo in Chicago. I've been doing IT support for 20 years and hope to make a change sometime soon. We love music in our household and listen to anything from Buddy Holly, Frankie Valley and the Four Seasons, Herman's Hermits, the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Doors, Queen, the Rolling Stones, Fleetwood Mac, to the Black Keys, Nathaniel Rateliff and the Night Sweats, Dave Matthews, the Raconteurs, Jack Johnson, Cage the Elephant, and the Shins. My hobbies include collecting comic books, reading, writing, drawing, meditation, Yoga, Tai Chi, and the practice of various Martial Arts forms and techniques. I dream of creating my own publishing company that produces digital and physical media for your reading pleasure. One day we hope to move to Georgia for warmer weather and sunnier days.</p>
