        <p>This is a tired mom in this picture. Dad was busy working two jobs while mom had to contend with potty training, cooking, cleaning, and constant diaper changes and bottle feeding. As much as mom loves being at home with her kids she hopes to one day start her own business.</p>

        <p>Grandma was in town this week from Florida to see the kids for Henry's birthday. She doesn't visit very frequently but we hope to see her again next Christmas. When the kids get big enough we plan to visit her and take a trip to Disney World.</p>
